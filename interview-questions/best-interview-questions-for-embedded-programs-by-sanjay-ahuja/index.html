</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Answers (by Nigel Jones) to some of the questions. Preprocessor</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Using the <code>#define</code> statement, how would you declare a manifest
   constant that returns the number of seconds in a year? Disregard
   leap years in your answer.</em></strong></p>
<p><code>#define SECONDS\_PER\_YEAR (60 \* 60 \* 24 \* 365)UL</code></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to test the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Basic knowledge of the #define syntax (for example, no semi-colon
    at the end, the need to parenthesize, and so on)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An understanding that the pre-processor will evaluate constant
    expressions for you. Thus, it is clearer, and penalty-free, to spell
    out how you are calculating the number of seconds in a year, rather
    than actually doing the calculation yourself</p>
</li>
<li>A realization that the expression will overflow an integer argument
    on a 16-bit machine- hence the need for the L, telling the compiler
    to treat the variable as a Long</li>
<li>As a bonus, if you modified the expression with a UL (indicating
    unsigned long), then you are off to a great start. And remember,
    first impressions count</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Write the "standard" MIN macro-that is, a macro that takes two
    arguments and returns the smaller of the two arguments.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>#define MIN(A,B) ((A) &lt; = (B) ? (A) : (B))</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this question is to test the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Basic knowledge of the #define directive as used in macros. This is important because
    until the inline operator becomes part of standard C, macros are the only portable way of
    generating inline code. Inline code is often necessary in embedded systems in order to
    achieve the required performance level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of the ternary conditional operator. This operator exists
    in C because it allows the compiler to produce more optimal code
    than an if-then-else sequence. Given that performance is normally an
    issue in embedded systems, knowledge and use of this construct is
    important</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding of the need to very carefully parenthesize arguments
    to macros</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also use this question to start a discussion on the side effects
    of macros, for example, what happens when you write code such as:</p>
<p><strong>least = MIN(*p++, b);</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>What is the purpose of the preprocessor directive #error?</em></strong></p>
<p>Either you know the answer to this, or you don\'t. If you don\'t, see
Reference 1. This question is useful for differentiating between normal
folks and the nerds. Only the nerds actually read the appendices of C
textbooks to find out about such things. Of course, if you aren\'t
looking for a nerd, the candidate better hope she doesn\'t know the
answer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="infinite-loops">Infinite loops</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Infinite loops often arise in embedded systems. How does you code
    an infinite loop in C?</em></strong></p>
<p>There are several solutions to this question. My preferred solution is:
<code>**while(1)**
**{**
**}**</code></p>
<p>Many programmers seem to prefer:
<code>**for(;;)**
**{**
**}**</code></p>
<p>This construct puzzles me because the syntax doesn\'t exactly spell out
what\'s going on. Thus, if a candidate gives this as a solution, I\'ll
use it as an opportunity to explore their rationale for doing so. If
their answer is basically, \"I was taught to do it this way and I
haven\'t thought about it since,\" it tells me something (bad) about
them.</p>
<p>A third solution is to use a goto :</p>
<p><code>**Loop:**
**\...**
**goto Loop;**</code></p>
<p>Candidates who propose this are either assembly language programmers
(which is probably good), or else they are closet BASIC/FORTRAN
programmers looking to get into a new field.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="data-declarations">Data declarations</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Using the variable a, give definitions for the following:</em></strong>
a)  <strong><em>An integer</em></strong>
b)  <strong><em>A pointer to an integer</em></strong>
c)  <strong><em>A pointer to a pointer to an integer</em></strong>
d)  <strong><em>An array of 10 integers</em></strong>
e)  <strong><em>An array of 10 pointers to integers</em></strong>
f)  <strong><em>A pointer to an array of 10 integers</em></strong>
g)  <strong><em>A pointer to a function that takes an integer as an argument and
    &gt; returns an integer</em></strong>
h)  <strong><em>An array of ten pointers to functions that take an integer
    argument and return an integer</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The answers are:</strong>
a)  <strong>int a; // An integer</strong>
b)  <strong>int *a; // A pointer to an integer</strong>
c)  <strong>int **a; // A pointer to a pointer to an integer</strong>
d)  <strong>int a[10]; // An array of 10 integers</strong>
e)  <strong>int *a[10]; // An array of 10 pointers to integers</strong>
f)  <strong>int (*a)[10]; // A pointer to an array of 10 integers</strong>
g)  <strong>int (*a)(int); // A pointer to a function a that takes an integer
    argument and returns an integer</strong>
h)  <strong>int (*a[10])(int); // An array of 10 pointers to functions that
    take an integer argument and return an integer</strong></p>
<p>People often claim that a couple of these are the sorts of thing that
one looks up in textbooks- and I agree. While writing this article, I
consulted textbooks to ensure the syntax was correct. However, I expect
to be asked this question (or something close to it) when I\'m being
interviewed. Consequently, I make sure I know the answers, at least for
the few hours of the interview. Candidates who don\'t know all the
answers (or at least most of them) are simply unprepared for the
interview. If they can\'t be prepared for the interview, what will they
be prepared for?</p>
<h1 id="static">Static</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>What are the uses of the keyword static?</em></strong>
This simple question is rarely answered completely. Static has three
distinct uses in C:</li>
<li>A variable declared static within the body of a function maintains
    its value between function invocations</li>
<li>A variable declared static within a module, (but outside the body of
    a function) is accessible by all functions within that module. It is
    not accessible by functions within any other module. That is, it is
    a localized global</li>
<li>Functions declared static within a module may only be called by
    other functions within that module. That is, the scope of the
    function is localized to the module within which it is declared</li>
</ol>
<p>Most candidates get the first part correct. A reasonable number get the
second part correct, while a pitiful number understand the third answer.
This is a serious weakness in a candidate, since he obviously doesn't
understand the importance and benefits of localizing the scope of both
data and code.</p>
<h1 id="const">Const</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>What does the keyword const mean?</em></strong>
As soon as the interviewee says "const means constant," I know I'm
dealing with an amateur. Dan Saks has exhaustively covered const in the
last year, such that every reader of ESP should be extremely familiar
with what const can and cannot do for you. If you haven't been reading
that column, suffice it to say that const means "read-only." Although
this answer doesn't really do the subject justice, I'd accept it as a
correct answer. (If you want the detailed answer, read Saks'
columns-carefully!)</li>
</ol>
<p>If the candidate gets the answer correct, I'll ask him these
supplemental questions:</p>
<p><strong><em>What do the following declarations mean?</em></strong></p>
<pre><code> const int a;
 int const a;
 const int *a;
 int * const a;
 int const * a const;
</code></pre>
<p>The first two mean the same thing, namely a is a const (read-only)
integer. The third means a is a pointer to a const integer (that is, the
integer isn\'t modifiable, but the pointer is). The fourth declares a to
be a const pointer to an integer (that is, the integer pointed to by a
is modifiable, but the pointer is not). The final declaration declares a
to be a const pointer to a const integer (that is, neither the integer
pointed to by a, nor the pointer itself may be modified). If the
candidate correctly answers these questions, I\'ll be impressed.
Incidentally, you might wonder why I put so much emphasis on const,
since it is easy to write a correctly functioning program without ever
using it. I have several reasons:
-   The use of const conveys some very useful information to someone
    reading your code. In effect, declaring a parameter const tells the
    user about its intended usage. If you spend a lot of time cleaning
    up the mess left by other people, you\'ll quickly learn to
    appreciate this extra piece of information. (Of course, programmers
    who use const , rarely leave a mess for others to clean up.)
-   const has the potential for generating tighter code by giving the
    optimizer some additional information
-   Code that uses const liberally is inherently protected by the
    compiler against inadvertent coding constructs that result in
    parameters being changed that should not be. In short,
they tend to have fewer bugs</p>
<h1 id="volatile">Volatile</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>What does the keyword volatile mean? Give three different examples of its use.</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A volatile variable is one that can change unexpectedly. Consequently,
the compiler can make no assumptions about the value of the variable. In
particular, the optimizer must be careful to reload the variable every
time it is used instead of holding a copy in a register. Examples of
volatile variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware registers in peripherals (for example, status registers)</li>
<li>Non-automatic variables referenced within an interrupt service
    routine</li>
<li>Variables shared by multiple tasks in a multi-threaded application</li>
</ul>
<p>Candidates who don't know the answer to this question aren't hired. I
consider this the most fundamental question that distinguishes between a
C programmer and an embedded systems programmer. Embedded folks deal
with hardware, interrupts, RTOSes, and the like. All of these require
volatile variables. Failure to understand the concept of volatile will
lead to disaster.</p>
<p>On the (dubious) assumption that the interviewee gets this question
correct, I like to probe a little deeper to see if they really
understand the full significance of volatile . In particular, I'll ask
them the following additional questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can a parameter be both const and volatile ? Explain.</li>
<li>Can a pointer be volatile ? Explain.</li>
<li>What's wrong with the following function?:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>int square(volatile int *ptr)
{

  return *ptr * *ptr;

}
</code></pre>
<p>The answers are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. An example is a read-only status register. It is volatile
    because it can change unexpectedly. It is const because the program
    should not attempt to modify it</li>
<li>Yes, although this is not very common. An example is when an
    interrupt service routine modifies a pointer to a buffer</li>
<li>This one is wicked. The intent of the code is to return the square
    of the value pointed to by *ptr . However, since *ptr points to a
    volatile parameter, the compiler will generate code that looks
    something like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>int square(volatile int \*ptr) 
{
  int a,b;
  a = *ptr;
  b = *ptr;
  return a * b;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because it's possible for the value of *ptr to change unexpectedly, it
is possible for a and b to be different. Consequently, this code could
return a number that is not a square! The correct way to code this is:</p>
<pre><code>long square(volatile int \*ptr) 
{

  int a;
  a = *ptr;
  return a * a;
}
</code></pre>
<h1 id="bit-manipulation"><strong>Bit manipulation</strong></h1>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Embedded systems always require the user to manipulate bits in
    registers or variables. Given an integer variable a, write two code
    fragments. The first should set bit 3 of a. The second should clear
    bit 3 of a. In both cases, the remaining bits should be
    unmodified.</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These are the three basic responses to this question:
-   No idea. The interviewee cannot have done any embedded systems work
-   Use bit fields. Bit fields are right up there with trigraphs as the
    most brain-dead portion of C. Bit fields are inherently non-portable
    across compilers, and as such guarantee that your code is not
    reusable. I recently had the misfortune to look at a driver written
    by Infineon for one of their more complex communications chips. It
    used bit fields and was completely useless because my compiler
    implemented the bit fields the other way around. The moral: never
    let a non-embedded person anywhere near a real piece of hardware!
-   Use #defines and bit masks. This is a highly portable method and is
    the one that should be used. My optimal solution to this problem
    would be:</p>
<pre><code> #define BIT3 (0x1 &lt;&lt;3)
 static int a;

 void set_bit3(void) {
     a |= BIT3;
 }

 void clear_bit3(void) {
     a &amp;= ~BIT3;
 }
</code></pre>
<p>Some people prefer to define a mask together with manifest constants for
the set and clear values. This is also acceptable. The element that I'm
looking for is the use of manifest constants, together with the |= and
&amp;= ~ constructs</p>
<h1 id="accessing-fixed-memory-locations">Accessing fixed memory locations</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Embedded systems are often characterized by requiring the
    programmer to access a specific memory location. On a certain
    project it is required to set an integer variable at the absolute
    address 0x67a9 to the value 0xaa55. The compiler is a pure ANSI
    compiler. Write code to accomplish this task.</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This problem tests whether you know that it is legal to typecast an
integer to a pointer in order to access an absolute location. The exact
syntax varies depending upon one\'s style. However, I would typically be
looking for something like this:</p>
<pre><code>int *ptr;

ptr = (int *)0x67a9;

*ptr = 0xaa55;
</code></pre>
<p>A more obscure approach is:</p>
<pre><code>*(int * const)(0x67a9) = 0xaa55;
</code></pre>
<p>Even if your taste runs more to the second solution, I suggest the first
solution when you are in an interview situation.</p>
<h1 id="interrupts">Interrupts</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Interrupts are an important part of embedded systems. Consequently, many 
    compiler vendors offer an extension to standard C to support interrupts. Typically, this
    new keyword is interrupt. The following code uses interrupt to define an 
    interrupt service routine (ISR). Comment on the code.</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>interrupt double compute_area (double radius)
{
    double area = PI * radius * radius;

    printf(&quot;\nArea = %f&quot;, area); return area;*

}
</code></pre>
<p>This function has so much wrong with it, it's hard to know where to
start:
-   ISRs cannot return a value. If you don't understand this, you
    aren't hired
-   ISRs cannot be passed parameters. See the first item for your
    employment prospects if you missed this
-   On many processors/compilers, floating-point operations are not
    necessarily re-entrant. In some cases one needs to stack additional
    registers. In other cases, one simply cannot do floating point in an
    ISR. Furthermore, given that a general rule of thumb is that ISRs
    should be short and sweet, one wonders about the wisdom of doing
    floating-point math here
-   In a vein similar to the third point, printf() often has problems
    with reentrancy and performance. If you missed points three and
    four, I wouldn't be too hard on you. Needless to say, if you got
    these last two points, your employment prospects are looking better
    and better</p>
<h1 id="code-examples">Code examples</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>What does the following code output and why?</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>void foo(void) {
    unsigned int a = 6; 
    int b = -20;

    (a+b &gt; 6) ? puts(&quot;&gt; 6&quot;) : puts(&quot;&lt;=6&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This question tests whether you understand the integer promotion rules
in C-an area that I find is very poorly understood by many developers.
Anyway, the answer is that this outputs "&gt; 6." The reason for this is
that expressions involving signed and unsigned types have all operands
promoted to unsigned types. Thus �comes a very large positive integer
and the expression evaluates to greater than 6. This is a very important
point in embedded systems where unsigned data types should be used
frequently (see Reference 2). If you get this one wrong, you are
perilously close to not getting the job.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Comment on the following code fragment.</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>unsigned int zero = 0;
unsigned int compzero = 0xFFFF;
/* 1's complement of zero */
</code></pre>
<p>On machines where an int is not 16 bits, this will be incorrect. It
should be coded:</p>
<pre><code>*unsigned int compzero = ~0;
</code></pre>
<p>This question really gets to whether the candidate understands the
importance of word length on
a computer. In my experience, good embedded programmers are critically
aware of the underlying hardware and its limitations, whereas computer
programmers tend to dismiss the hardware as a necessary annoyance.</p>
<p>By this stage, candidates are either completely demoralized-or they're
on a roll and having a good time. If it\'s obvious that the candidate
isn\'t very good, then the test is terminated at this point. However, if
the candidate is doing well, then I throw in these supplemental
questions. These questions are hard, and I expect that only the very
best candidates will do well on them. In posing these questions, I'm
looking more at the way the candidate tackles the problems, rather than
the answers. Anyway, have fun...</p>
<h1 id="dynamic-memory-allocation">Dynamic memory allocation</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Although not as common as in non-embedded computers, embedded
    systems do still dynamically allocate memory from the heap. What are
    the problems with dynamic memory allocation in embedded systems?</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Here, I expect the user to mention memory fragmentation, problems with
garbage collection, variable execution time, and so on. This topic has
been covered extensively in <em>ESP</em> , mainly by</p>
<p>P.J. Plauger. His explanations are far more insightful than anything I
could offer here, so go and read those back issues! Having lulled the
candidate into a sense of false security, I then offer up this tidbit:</p>
<p><strong><em>What does the following code fragment output and why?</em></strong></p>
<pre><code>char *ptr;
if ((ptr = (char *)malloc(0)) == NULL)
else
    puts(&quot;Got a null pointer&quot;); 
    puts(&quot;Got a valid pointer&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This is a fun question. I stumbled across this only recently when a
colleague of mine inadvertently passed a value of 0 to malloc and got
back a valid pointer! That is, the above code will output "Got a valid
pointer." I use this to start a discussion on whether the interviewee
thinks this is the correct thing for the library routine to do. Getting
the right answer here is not nearly as important as the way you approach
the problem and the rationale for your decision.</p>
<h1 id="typedef">Typedef</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>Typedef <em>is frequently used in C to declare synonyms for
    pre-existing data types. It is also possible to use the preprocessor
    to do something similar. For instance, consider the following code
    fragment:</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>#define dPS struct s * 
typedef struct s * tPS;
</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>The intent in both cases is to define</em> dPS <em>and</em> tPS *to be
pointers to structure s. Which method, if any, is preferred and why?</strong>*</p>
<p>This is a very subtle question, and anyone who gets it right (for the
right reason) is to be congratulated or condemned ("get a life"
springs to mind). The answer is the typedef is preferred. Consider the
declarations:</p>
<pre><code>dPS p1,p2;
tPS p3,p4;
</code></pre>
<p>The first expands to:</p>
<pre><code>struct s* p1, p2;
</code></pre>
<p>which defines p1 to be a pointer to the structure and p2 to be an actual
structure, which is probably not what you wanted. The second example
correctly defines p3 and p4 to be pointers.</p>
<h1 id="obscure-syntax">Obscure syntax</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>C allows some appalling constructs. Is this construct legal, and
    if so what does this code do?</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>    int a = 5, b = 7, c;
    c = a+++b;
</code></pre>
<p>This question is intended to be a lighthearted end to the quiz, as,
believe it or not, this is perfectly legal syntax. The question is how
does the compiler treat it? Those poor compiler writers actually debated
this issue, and came up with the "maximum munch" rule, which
stipulates that the compiler should bite off as big (and legal) a chunk
as it can. Hence, this code is treated as:</p>
<pre><code>    c = a++ + b;
</code></pre>
<p>Thus, after this code is executed, a = 6, b = 7, and c = 12.</p>
<p>If you knew the answer, or guessed correctly, well done. If you didn't
know the answer then I wouldn't consider this to be a problem. I find
the greatest benefit of this question is that it is good for stimulating
questions on coding styles, the value of code reviews, and the benefits
of using lint.</p>
